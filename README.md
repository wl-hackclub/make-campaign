# Make.
Last week, we ran a poster campaign in our school to promote Hack Club. The strategy was to post vague but colorful posters around the school, and gradually add new things to the posters until we have a full Hack Club poster. This isn't meant to get more people to join the club in the short term, especially since we're already halfway through the first semester and people's schedules are full. Rather, the point is to make sure everyone in the school knows _what_ Hack Club is, which is far more important for the club and its reputation in the long term.
# Why?
This campaign was inspired by a video I saw called [The Science of Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM). In it, Derek from Veritasium explains that your brain is composed of a "Drew" brain and a "Gun" brain. The Drew brain is your working memory, which checks things to make sure they're correct, and stores information short-term, but is very lazy. The Gun brain is the part of your brain that automates tasks it has already learned. One example Derek brings up is [the "Un" campaign](https://youtu.be/UBVV8pch1dM?t=563) that rolled out in Sydney. Appealing to Drew and making that part of the brain work harder actually makes an advertisement more memorable than an advertisement that appeals to Gun because it's so different than every other type of advertising.

I wanted to avoid including anything that indicates this is a coding club, even through to the final poster. This sounds counterintuitive, since I'm trying to get people to join a coding club, but what I've found is that people immediately say "Oh I don't know that, it sounds scary" as soon as they hear anything related to coding. I think this is because people see coding as something that you have to be super smart to do, or something that is super complex, so they're intimidated by it. But if this is a club where you go to make things, it sounds a lot less scary. **Thus, the Make campaign was born.**

# Monday

Just a simple vague but colorful poster. This got a lot of people talking.

# Tuesday

I printed these 6 to page and cut them out as flyers. I wanted to print 15 pages (90 flyers) but I got to 50 before I ran out of ink. All throughout the day, I threw these all around the school--on people's desks in class, on the floor in the hallways, on benches, on tables, everywhere I could possibly think of.

# Wednesday

Wednesday was a big day. I replaced the original Make posters with one that had a link to a vague site that had the text from the Tuesday flyers and prompted the user to enter their email for more info.

I also created a QR code from Hack Club's mascot, Orpheus, that led to that website, and printed out flyers with it. This time, I actually managed to print 15 pages (90 flyers). This _really_ got people talking.

# Thursday
I decided not to do anything on Thursday. I wanted to make sure I wasn't introducing too many new things before some people got a chance to catch up on the previous day's things. So, on Thursday, I took a break.

# Friday and Monday
We have a new intermediate school opening up in our district, and we had Fall Break early this year so that the faculty at the current intermediate school could move all of the things over to the new intermediate school. So, we didn't have school on Friday or Monday to promote.

# Tuesday

Tuesday was the final day. We put up the posters that finally revealed what this campaign was all about.

But that wasn't all we did. We also [redesigned our club's website](https://wl.hackclub.com) and sent out an email to everyone who entered their email on the website during the QR code day. We had about 15 legitimate signups, so 15 people receieved [this beautiful email](https://mailchi.mp/bef906d8a28e/what-it-means-to-be-a-maker).
